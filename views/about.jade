  h3 What is this?

  | Ballyhoo is an application for letting attendees at large Meetup events submit announcements 
  | in advance, allowing real-time projection of announcements onto a screen, and making it easier
  | for people to make contact afterwards.
  
  h3 How do I make an announcement?

  | If your Meetup has a Ballyhoo user, then use the Meetup web or mobile interface to send them 
  | a message. Put the desired content of the announcement in the Subject: line, and put any URL
  | you'd like to include in the body of the message. That's it! You'll receive an email message 
  | to validate that the announcement is as you'd like it, and then the Meetup organizer can 
  | make your announcement visible, either in advance or in real time.

  | instructions for your own Meetup, and the source!
