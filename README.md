_Making Meetup Event Announcements Fast and Useful!_

    noun \ˈba-lē-ˌhü\

* a noisy attention-getting demonstration or talk
* flamboyant, exaggerated, or sensational promotion or publicity
* excited commotion


Does your Meetup event get bogged down by people announcing jobs, events, and other things? Do people announce amazing
opportunities, then disappear before actual connections are made? Then Ballyhoo is for you! Here's how it works:

1. Users create announcements _before_ the event, including their name, a URL, and a short text announcement. All that users need to do is send email via the Meetup.com website or mobile app to a custom Meetup user -- Ballyhoo.
2. During the event, as people make announcements aloud, an event organizer can promote queued announcements to make them visible. Visible announcements can be projected onto a big screen for users to see. Updates happen in real time!
4. Announcements have the name, URL, and text, plus a photo of the announcer. It's easy to follow up now!

Ballyhoo design and coding is led by Harlan Harris.
